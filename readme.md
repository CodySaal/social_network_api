# Social Network API

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice using MongoDB which is a noSQL database. Along with MongoDB I was able to practice using Mongoose, which is a Node.js package that provides a shema-based solution. The API allows users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. While building this application I also got to practice using Express for routing as well. We have been using Express for awhile now so it is starting to get faster to write.
